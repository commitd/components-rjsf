# Committed Components RJSF

<code>v{version}</code>

This is Committed's design system extension for [React JSON Schema Forms](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Install the library and peer-dependencies in your application

<code>npm add @committed/components-rjsf@{version}</code>

Pass the JSON Schema to the `JSForm` component and receive the form data via the `onSubmit`.

```tsx
import { JSForm } from '@committed/components-rjsf'
import React from 'react'

export const MyForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    // handle e.formData
  }

  return <JSForm schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
}
```

For further examples see the stories.

The stories in each section are designed to exercise the custom component for the Committed theming of React JSON Schema Forms.

## üëè Credits

This library uses the examples from the react-jsonscehma-form [demo site](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/) and some documentation
from the [Docs site](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Code borrows from implementation in the main library.

Thanks to the excellent work by the [rjsf-team](https://github.com/rjsf-team).
